# Test Driven Development in Modern Fortran
this repository is my study log to learn how do I develop my Fortran program through the test-driven development.
This study proceeds by following "Test-Driven Development by Example" by Kent Beck.

- Current Fortran codes correspond to the example in chapter 2.

## Concerns
- How to implement the constructors of Objects in Fortran
- How to implement assertions in Fortran
